# chat_analysis_wa

This project is to do WhatsApp's Chat Analysis and make bunch of  graphs also to practice follwing topics to
get better idea.

	- Sqlite3 - To store history data of chats
	- Matplotlib - to make figures
	- Files - Reading(Which is like no work)
	- Numpy - For bar graphs

### How will we do it?
	- First we will read every line from files (which is done by main.py) and do some formating so that we could
	add into database.
	- After it is in database we can get whatever information we want and use it to plot graphes. 
	easy peasy japanesey, right?
	
### Results

	- Bar chart of messages sent by each users.
